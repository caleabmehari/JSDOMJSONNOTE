# Java scrpit

• [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/JavaScript) is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)

# Basic functions of js

# **javascrip can change HTML content**

⇒ getElementById() it’s’ one of js method and it’s case sensative so we can’t write as we want . 

```jsx
/*the way we write */
document.getElementById("place for id").innerHTML="content we want to replace"

/*example */

<html>
<body>
<h1>caleabs first js demo<h1>
<p id="demo1">contennt</p> /* the id is necessary to acess with js*/

<button type="button" onclick='document.getElementById("demo1").innerHTML=
"replece the content"'>click
</button>
</body>
</html>
```

⇒ JavaScript accepts both double and single quotes:

# JavaScript Can Change HTML Styles (CSS)

```jsx
/*example*/
<html>
<body>
<h1>js can change the html style</h1>
<p id="demo2">caleabmehari</p>
<button type="click" onclick="document.getElementById('demo2').style.fontSize='25px'">click</button>
/*in the palce of .innerHTML replace .style.fontsize */
</body>
</html>
```

# **JavaScript Can Hide and show HTML Elements**

Hiding HTML elements can be done by changing the `display`  style

```jsx
/*instead of innerHTML replece .style.display="none" none used to hide*/
document.getElementById("demo").style.display = "none";
```

Showing hidden HTML elements can also be done by changing the `display`  style

```jsx
/*changing the behaviour of the html style by blocking the properties*/
<p id="demo" style="display:none">Hello JavaScript!</p>/*the HTML style=display:none*/
document.getElementById("demo").style.display = "block"/*js changes the js by blocking the behaviour*/
```

# **The <script> Tag**

The javascript  code inserted b/n <script> </script>. 

```jsx
<script>
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML="this caleab";
/*we don't use qouts when we are wrriting code in sscript code*/
</script>
```

# JavaScript in <head> or <body>

⇒Scripts can be placed in the `<body>` , or in the `<head>` section of an HTML page, or in both.

⇒and we can insert/use  any number <script> in the html code.

JavaScript `function` is placed in the `<body>` or `<head>` section of an HTML page.The function is invoked (called) when a button is clicked

```jsx
<html>
/*script function when replecd in the head scetion*/
<head>
<script>
function myheadfun()    /*this the opening of head fun*/
{
documemt.getElementById("demoh").innerHTML="the head one";
}
</script>
</head>

/*script function when we use in the body section */
<body>
<h1>This caleabs more demo</h1>
<p id="demoh">script in head ecample</p>
<p id="demob">script in body example</p>
<button type="button" onclick="myfuction()">click here</button>

<script>
function mybodyfun()      /*this is the opening if the function */
{
document.getElementById("demob").innerHTML="head and body";
}
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

Placing scripts at the bottom of the <body> element improves the display speed, because script interpretation slows down the display.

# **External JavaScript**

⇒JavaScript files have the file extension **.js**

⇒To use an external script, put the name of the script file in the `src` (source) attribute of a `<script>`
 

```jsx
<script src="myScript.js"></script>
```

Advantages of eexternal javascript

⇒It sparate the HTML with the js code

⇒it allows us to maintain and read html and js code easily 

⇒Cached JavaScript files can speed up page loads.

and we can use several scrpits to link external js

# JavaScript Output

# **Using innerHTML**

Writing into an HTML element, using `innerHTML`

To access an HTML element, JavaScript can use the `document.getElementById(id)`
 method

 `id:`attribute defines the HTML element. 

`innerHTML`:property defines the HTML content.

```jsx
<html>
<body>
<h1>this html part</h1>
<p>this also the html part</p>
<p id="demo4"></p>
<script>
document.getElementById("demo4").innerHTML="5+6";
</script>
</body>
</html>
```

# **JavaScript Print**

`window.print():`method in the browser to print the content of the current window.

```jsx
<html>
<body>

<button onclick="window.print()">Print this page</button>

</body>
</html>
```

# JavaScript Keywords

JavaScript statements often start with a **keyword** to identify the JavaScript action to be performed.

Our [Reserved Words Reference](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_reserved.asp) lists all JavaScript keywords

| Keyword | Description |
| --- | --- |
| var | Declares a variable |
| let | Declares a block variable |
| const | Declares a block constant |
| if | Marks a block of statements to be executed on a condition |
| switch | Marks a block of statements to be executed in different cases |
| for | Marks a block of statements to be executed in a loop |
| function | Declares a function |
| return | Exits a function |
| try | Implements error handling to a block of statements |

# **JavaScript Values**

The JavaScript syntax defines two types of values:

- Fixed values: are called **Literals**.
- Variable values are called **Variables**.

**JavaScript Literals**

⇒ There are two rules for literals for number and strings

**For numbers:**numebrs can be written with or without decimal .

**For Strings:** written within double or single quotes.

   **JavaScript Variables**

**variables:**are used to **store** data values

⇒JavaScript uses thekeywords `var,let,const` to **declare**variables.

```jsx
<html>
<body>
<p>the value of x is assign for the id demo</p>
<p id="demo6"></p>

<script>
let x;
x=6;
document.getElementById("demo6").innerHTML=x;/*this x assign for the demo6*/
</script>
</body>
</html>
```

# **JavaScript Identifiers / Names**

Identifiers are JavaScript names.

Identifiers are used to name variables and keywords, and functions.

A JavaScript name must begin with:

- A letter (A-Z or a-z)
- A dollar sign ($)
- Or an underscore (_)

# **JavaScript and Camel Case**

**Hyphens:first-name, last-name, master-card, inter-city.**

hyphens are not allowed in JavaScript. They are reserved for subtractions.

**Underscore:**

first_name, last_name, master_card, inter_city

**Upper Camel Case (Pascal Case):**

FirstName, LastName, MasterCard, InterCity//the first letter begin with the upper letter 

**Lower Camel Case:**

JavaScript programmers tend to use camel case that starts with a lowercase letter:

firstName, lastName, masterCard, interCity.//with all the lower case letter and without any space 

# Ways to Declare a JavaScript Variable:

- Using `var`
- Using `let`
- Using `const`
- Using nothing

**CONST:**If you want a general rule: always declare variables with `const`.and it will be access globally 

**LET:**If you think the value of the variable can change, and we can only access in the locally level and it will run locally it mean it’s scoped in block.

****Var:**** `var` declarations are globally scoped or function/locally scoped

⇒The scope is global when a `var` variable is declared outside a function. This means that any variable that is declared with `var`
 outside a function block is available for use in the whole window.

⇒`var`is function scoped when it is declared within a function. This means that it is available and can be accessed only within that function.

# **JavaScript Data Types**

Js can handle many type of data type the main 

1.strings:written inside double or single quotes 

2.numbers are written without quotes.i f you put a number in quotes, it will be treated as a text string.

# Declaring a JavaScript Variable

⇒creating a variable in Js is called “declaring” a variable.

*we can declare a JavaScript variable with the `var`or the `let`keyword

```jsx
let carname;//with let keyword
var carname;//with var keyword
```

After the declaration, the variable has no value (technically it is `undefined`,so after we decler we must assign the value for the variable 

```jsx
let carname;
carname="toyota";/*we create a variable called carName and assign the value "toyota" to it*/
```

```jsx
<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
let carName = "toyota";
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = carName;
</script>//so the out put is toyota
```

⇒It's a good programming practice to declare all variables at the beginning of a script.

**Value = undefined:**A variable declared without a value will have the value `undefined`

```jsx
let carname;//if we leave as it is ,it's undifind value till we assign for the variable 

```

**Re-Declaring JavaScript Variables:**If you re-declare a JavaScript variable declared with `var,` it will not lose its value.

⇒we cannot re-declare a variable declared with `let` or `const`

**JavaScript Dollar Sign $:** Since JavaScript treats a dollar sign as a letter, identifiers containing $ are valid variable names.

:

```jsx
let $ = "caleab";
let $$$ = 5;
let $caleab= 10;
```

# **JavaScript Let**

⇒Variables defined with `let` **can not be redeclared**.

⇒Variables defined with `let` **must be declared before use**.

⇒Variables defined with `let` **have block scope**.

```jsx
let x="caleabm";
let x=0; //we can't do this(redecler)

//but with var we can redecler

var x="caleabm";
var  x=0;// we can do this 
```

**Block Scope:**JavaScript had **Global Scope** and **Function Scope**

.

```jsx
{
let x=2;//x can't be used here
}

{
var x=2; x //can be used here it's not block scope
}  
```

# **JavaScript Data Types**

# JavaScript has 8 Datatypes

1. String2. Number3. Bigint4. Boolean5. Undefined6. Null7. Symbol8. Object

# The Object Datatype

The object data type can contain:

1. An object2. An array3. A date

```jsx
// Numbers:
let length = 16;
let weight = 7.5;

// Strings:
let color = "Yellow";
let lastName = "Johnson";

// Booleans
let x = true;
let y = false;

// Object:
const person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe"};

// Array object:
const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];

// Date object:
const date = new Date("2022-03-25");
```

⇒When adding a number and a string, JavaScript will treat the number as a string.

⇒JavaScript evaluates expressions from left to right. Different sequences can produce different results:

# **JavaScript Functions**

A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).

```jsx
<html>
<body>

<h2>JavaScript Functions</h2>

<p>This example calls a function which performs a calculation, and returns the result:</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
function myFunction(p1, p2) {
  return p1 * p2;
}
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = myFunction(4, 3);
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

# Function Invocation

The code inside the function will execute when "something" **invokes** (calls) the function:

- When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button)
- When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code
- Automatically (self invoked)

# Function Return

When JavaScript reaches a `return` statement, the function will stop executing.

If the function was invoked from a statement, JavaScript will "return" to execute the code after the invoking statement.

Functions often compute a **return value**. The return value is "returned" back to the "caller":

# Object Definition

You define (and create) a JavaScript object with an object literal:

Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values.

```jsx
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  age: 50,
  eyeColor: "blue"
};
```

# **Conditional Statements**

```jsx
if (time < 10) {
  greeting = "Good morning";
} else if (time < 20) {
  greeting = "Good day";
} else {
  greeting = "Good evening";
}
```

# **Loops**

# The For In Loop

The JavaScript `for in` statement loops through the properties of an Object:

# The For Of Loop

The JavaScript `for of` statement loops through the values of an iterale object.

It lets you loop over iterale data structures such as Arrays, Strings, Maps, NodeLists, and more:

```jsx
for (let i = 0; i < cars.length; i++) {
  text += cars[i] + "<br>";
}

const person = {fname:"John", lname:"Doe", age:25};

//for in 
let text = "";
for (let x in person) {
  text += person[x];
}

//for of
const cars = ["BMW", "Volvo", "Mini"];

let text = "";
for (let x of cars) {
  text += x;
}
```

# Function

```jsx
let x = myFunction(4, 3);   // Function is called, return value will end up in x

function myFunction(a, b) {
  return a * b;             // Function returns the product of a and b
}
```

# Events

some of JS EVENTS

- When a user clicks the mouse
- When a web page has loaded
- When an image has been loaded
- When the mouse moves over an element
- When an input field is changed
- When an HTML form is submitted
- When a user strokes a key

The `onload`and `onunload` events are triggered when the user enters or leaves the page.

The `onchange` event is often used in combination with validation of input fields.

The `onmouseover` and `onmouseout` events can be used to trigger a function when the user mouses over, or out of, an HTML element:

The `onmousedown`, `onmouseup`, and `onclick` events are all parts of a mouse-click. First when a mouse-button is clicked, the onmousedown event is triggered, then, when the mouse-button is released, the onmouseup event is triggered, finally, when the mouse-click is completed, the onclick event is triggered.

# Document Object Model(DOM)

**Browser JavaScript interface to HTML document**
● HTML document exposed as a collection of JavaScript objects and methods
The Document Object Model (DOM)
● JavaScript can query or modify the HTML document
● Accessible via the JavaScript global scope, aliases:
window
this (When not using 'use strict';)

**DOM hierarchy**
● Rooted at window.document (html tag)
● Follows HTML document structure
window.document.head
window.document.body
● Tree nodes (DOM objects) have tons (~250) of properties, most private
Objects (representing elements, raw text, etc.) have a common set of
properties and methods called a DOM "Node

**DOM Node properties and methods**
● Identification
nodeName property is element type (uppercase: P, DIV, etc.) or #text
● Encode document's hierarchical structure
parentNode, nextSibling, previousSibling, firstChild, lastChild.
● Provide accessor and mutator methods
E.g. getAttribute, setAttribute methods, etc.

Accessing DOM Nodes
● Walk DOM hierarchy (not recommended)
element = document.body.firstChild.nextSibling.firstChild;
element.setAttribute(…
● Use DOM lookup method. An example using ids:
HTML: <div id="div42">...</div>
element = document.getElementById("div42");
element.setAttribute(…
● Many: getElementsByClassName(), getElementsByTagName(), …
○ Can start lookup at any element:
document.body.firstChild.getElementsByTagName()

Common DOM mutating operations
● Change the content of an element
element.innerHTML = "This text is

*important*

";
Replaces content but retains attributes. DOM Node structure updated.
● Change an

DOM and CSS interactions
● Can update an element's class
element.className = "active";
● Can update element's style
element.style.color = "#ff0000"; // Not preferred way!
● Can also query DOM by CSS selector
document.querySelector() and document.querySelectorAll()

**Positioning elements**
● Normally elements are positioned automatically by the browser as part of the
document
● To pull an element out of the document flow and position it explicitly:
element.style.position = "absolute"; // anything but "static"
element.style.left = "40px";
element.style.top = "10px";
"absolute" - the element no longer occupies space in the document flow.
● The origin inside an offsetParent (for positioning descendants) is just inside
the upper-left corner of its border.

**Positioning context**
● Each element has an offsetParent (some ancestor element).
● When an element is positioned, coordinates such as element.style.left
are relative to its offsetParent.
● Default offsetParent is the <body> element.
● Some elements define a new positioning context:
○ position CSS attribute is absolute (element is explicitly positioned)
○ position CSS attribute is relative (element is positioned automatically by the browser in
the usual way)
○ This element will become the offsetParent for all its descendents (unless overridden by
another positioning context)

# **JSON**

JSON or JavaScript Object Notation is a lightweight text-based open standard designed for
human-readable data interchange. Conventions used by JSON are known to programmers,
which include C, C++, Java, Python, Perl, etc.
 JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation.
 The format was specified by Douglas Crockford.
 It was designed for human-readable data interchange.
 It has been extended from the JavaScript scripting language.
 The filename extension is .json.
 JSON Internet Media type is application/json.
 The Uniform Type Identifier is public.json

**Uses of JSON**
 It is used while writing JavaScript based applications that includes browser extensions
and websites.
 JSON format is used for serializing and transmitting structured data over network
connection.
 It is primarily used to transmit data between a server and web applications.
 Web services and APIs use JSON format to provide public data.
 It can be used with modern programming languages.

# **Characteristics of JSON**
**JSON is easy to read and write.
 ⇒It is a lightweight text-based interchange format.
⇒JSON is language independent.
Simple Example in JSON**

```jsx
1. 6
{
"book": [
{
"id":"01",
"language": "Java",
"edition": "third",
"author": "Herbert Schildt"
},
{
"id":"07",
"language": "C++",
"edition": "second"
"author": "E.Balagurusamy"
}]
}
After understanding the above program, we will try another example. Let's save the below
code as json.htm:
<html>
<head>
<title>JSON example</title>
<script language="javascript" >

var object1 = { "language" : "Java", "author" : "herbert schildt" };
document.write("<h1>JSON with JavaScript example</h1>");
document.write("<br>");
document.write("<h3>Language = " + object1.language+"</h3>");
document.write("<h3>Author = " + object1.author+"</h3>");
var object2 = { "language" : "C++", "author" : "E-Balagurusamy" };
document.write("<br>");
document.write("<h3>Language = " + object2.language+"</h3>");
JSON
7
document.write("<h3>Author = " + object2.author+"</h3>");

document.write("<hr />");
document.write(object2.language + " programming language can be studied " +
"from book written by " + object2.author);
document.write("<hr />");

</script>
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>

Now let's try to open json.htm using IE or any other javascript enabled browser that produces
the following result:
